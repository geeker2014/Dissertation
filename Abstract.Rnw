Calibration is an important and controversial topic in statistics. In this dissertation we consider both semiparametric calibration and the application of calibration to grouped data, both of which involve the use of linear mixed-effects models. In Chapter~\ref{chap:nonparametric}, we propose a method for obtaining calibration intervals that have good coverage probability when the calibration curve has been estimated "semiparametrically". We also expand the traditional Bayesian approach to calibration by allowing for a semiparametric calibration curve. In Chapter~\ref{chp:cal-dependent}, we extend the usual methods for statistical calibration to the case of grouped data, that is, where observations can be categorized into a finite set of homogenous clusters. A characteristic of grouped data is that observations belonging to the same cluster are not independent, thus, must be modelled more carefully (e.g., using mixed-effects models). We start by extending the classical Wald and inversion methods for obtaining calibration intervals, then we propose a new parametric bootstrap algorithm that, presumably, performs better for calibration in linear mixed-effects models by relaxing certain normality assumptions that may not be satisfied in practice. Finally, in Appendix~\ref{app:investr}, we describe the R package \texttt{investr} we have developed for analyzing calibration problems.
